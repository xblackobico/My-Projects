 Capstone Project for Data Science - Tinyuka Session
Project Overview
In this capstone project, you will apply your data science and machine learning
skills to develop a predictive model for house prices. This project will involve
data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature engineering, model
training, and evaluation. You will use a real-world dataset to build a model that
can accurately predict house prices based on various features.
Instruction Prompts
Project Introduction
Objective: Develop a machine learning model to predict house prices using a
dataset containing various house-related features.
Dataset: You will use the "House Prices - Advanced Regression Techniques"
dataset from Kaggle (or any other relevant house price dataset).
Project Phases
Phase 1: Data Collection and Preparation
Task 1.1: Download the dataset from Kaggle or another source.
Task 1.2: Load the dataset into a Pandas DataFrame.
Task 1.3: Inspect the dataset for missing values and handle them appropriately.
Task 1.4: Perform data cleaning to ensure the dataset is ready for analysis.
Phase 2: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Task 2.1: Conduct exploratory data analysis to understand the distribution of
features and the target variable (house prices).
Task 2.2: Visualize the relationships between features and the target variable
using scatter plots, histograms, and box plots.
Task 2.3: Identify and handle outliers in the dataset.
Phase 3: Feature Engineering
Task 3.1: Create new features that may help improve the model's performance.
Task 3.2: Encode categorical variables using one-hot or label encoding
techniques.
Task 3.3: Normalize or standardize numerical features as needed.
Phase 4: Model Training and Evaluation
Task 4.1: Split the dataset into training and testing sets.
Task 4.2: Choose and justify the selection of machine learning algorithms (e.g.,
Linear Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting).
Task 4.3: Train multiple models and evaluate their performance using
appropriate metrics (e.g., RMSE, MAE, RÂ²).
Task 4.4: Perform hyperparameter tuning to optimize the model's performance.
Task 4.5: Select and evaluate the best-performing model on the testing set.
Phase 5: Model Interpretation and Reporting
Task 5.1: Interpret the results of the best-performing model and explain the
importance of critical features.
Task 5.2: Create visualizations to support your findings and model
interpretations.
Task 5.3: Write a comprehensive report summarizing the project, including the
methodology, results, and conclusions.
Deliverables
Code: Submit the complete code used for data preparation, EDA, feature
engineering, model training, and evaluation (Jupyter Notebook format)
Report: Submit a detailed report (PDF or Jupyter Notebook format)
documenting your approach, findings, and conclusions. The report should
include visualizations and a clear explanation of your steps.
Presentation: Prepare a brief presentation (5-10 slides) summarizing your
project and key findings.
